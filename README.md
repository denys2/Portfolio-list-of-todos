# Project "React Dynamic TODO List" for Portfolio

This project is a dynamic to-do list developed using React technology. The purpose of this task was to teach you how to work effectively with a vague task description, examine existing code before starting work, and understand the importance of testing.

Main tasks and functionality of the project:
Loading and Displaying Tasks:

Loading tasks from the API after the App component is loaded.
Displaying tasks using the TodoList component.
Using Loader:

Displaying a Loader while waiting for data from the server.
Using the wait function in api.ts for the proper functioning of the Loader.
Interaction with TodoModal:

Opening TodoModal with a selected task after clicking the "Show" button.
Loading user information (replace 1 with the actual userId).
Displaying a Loader while waiting for user information.
Closing the modal window using the "x" button.
Filtering and Searching:

Filtering tasks by status: all, completed, and active (unfinished).
Using input in TodoFilter to filter tasks by title.
Displaying the "x" button when a query is entered.
The "x" button clears the query and resets the task filtration.
This project demonstrates my ability to interact effectively with React, solve tasks with asynchronous data loading, implement modal window functionality, and realize the filtration and search of a large amount of data.
